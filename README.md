# 🚗 Obstacle Avoiding Robot using Arduino

This project demonstrates an **Obstacle Avoiding Robot** built using an **Arduino**, **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**, and **L298N Motor Driver**.  
The robot automatically detects obstacles in front of it and changes direction to avoid collisions.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Detects obstacles using ultrasonic distance measurement
- Stops and turns left when an obstacle is closer than **10 cm**
- Simple logic without servo motor
- Ideal for beginners in robotics and embedded systems

---

## 🧠 Working Logic
- Distance > 10 cm → Robot moves forward
- Distance ≤ 10 cm → Robot stops and turns left
